KOJI is the token of the people. It is a distributed, worldwide, decentralized
digital token designed to help the population by giving back, donating to
charitable organizations.

Simply put, KOJI is a hybrid digital token: a DeFi Charity following a
deflationary model with redistribution features and regular NFT drops. The
leading mutual-aid token aiming to help the world with an automatic 3% tax on
every transaction, buy and/or sell.

KOJIs are issued and managed without any central authority: there is no
government, company, or bank in charge of KOJI

KOJI is a community driven token based in the Ethereum network. The
specific tokenomics were decided by our community, and we will continue to
involve KOJI's community as much as possible.

The development team is entirely composed of volunteers covering a wide
range of skills, that have dedicated long hours and hard work to making this
project a reality
